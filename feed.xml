        <title>Why I hope you'll submit to Scheme Workshop</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thomas.gilray.org/scheme-2019/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link to this year’s Scheme Workshop CFP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the workshop on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schemeworkshop.org/&quot;&gt;Scheme
and Functional Programming&lt;/a&gt;. The
Scheme Workshop represents a diverse community of hackers, academics,
and enthusiasts. The workshop offers a forum to share insights,
experience, and technical developments of and within the Scheme family
of programming languages. Rather than focus on a specific
implementation or community, workshop attendees are united by an
appreciation for succinct expression of novel ideas realized via
programming. The submission deadline is &lt;strong&gt;May 24th, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;, I hope
you’ll help us celebrate by submitting a paper!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-scheme-workshop&quot;&gt;What is Scheme Workshop?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Scheme Workshop website describes it as a…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yearly meeting of programming language practitioners who share an
  aesthetic sense embodied by the Algorithmic Language Scheme:
  universality through minimalism, and flexibility through rigorous
  design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my personal take. I love Scheme Workshop because it brings
together a group of people with a truly unique perspective on
programming. We represent a diverse background, but a shared vision:
to distill insights about programming to their most economic
presentation. We appreciate thoughtful, comprehensible solutions to
challenging problems. We challenge ourselves to step outside of our
boundaries and build fundamentally new paradigms for expressing
ideas. Our mission is to build a community where we foster diversity,
education, and support each other in pursuit of these ideals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scheme Workshop is unique in that it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open to everyone who cares about Scheme-ish ideas&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead of
   focusing on promoting the most cutting edge results, Scheme
   Workshop centers around thoughtful discussions relating to unique
   ideas that embody the ethos of Scheme. You don’t have to be an
   academic to attend; in fact, we have a rich history of
   participation from hobbyists and industrial attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-archival and open access&lt;/strong&gt;. We aim to support and foster unique
  ideas. Naturally, some of these ideas may grow into work
  eventually submitted to research conferences. Scheme Workshop
  provides a platform for researchers to get perspective from the
  Scheme community on their work at all stages of development. While
  we publish a technical report of submitted papers, submission to
  Scheme Workshop does not preclude subsequent submission to
  archival research conferences. In fact, we see Scheme Workshop as
  an ideal proving ground for groundbreaking research ideas. We hope
  that the discussions generated by the presentation of those ideas
  at Scheme Workshop will productively inform the authors’
  scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supportive of off-the-wall ideas&lt;/strong&gt;. There are some ideas that
  are really interesting, kind of zany, and just inspire us in a
  deep way we can’t quite put our finger on. These ideas aren’t
  necessarily the kind that would fit well at a programming-oriented
  conference, but they might not be a good fit for research
  conferences either. Scheme Workshop is a perfect venue for these
  kinds of ideas. You’ll find like-minded people who enjoy
  challenging their perspectives on what programming even means.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A great place for your first paper&lt;/strong&gt;. We place an emphasis on
  giving thoughtful, high-quality, and friendly reviews. We also
  have a strong appreciation for “half-baked” ideas. When I was a
  beginning PhD student, submitting to so-called top conferences
  often felt overwhelming. Scheme Workshop wants to help budding
  researchers develop their writing and presentation. Similarly, we
  realize that great ideas can come from people in industry, the
  open-source community, or the broader hobbyist community. We work
  hard to ensure that their ideas are taken seriously and give them
  the feedback they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-about-racket-haskell-clojure-sml-c-etc&quot;&gt;What about Racket, Haskell, Clojure, SML, C++, etc…?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The language isn’t what’s important, it’s the idea. We want the
workshop to be filled with exciting talks that broaden our horizons
and challenge us to think about programming in a way we wouldn’t have
before. I could easily imagine relevant papers dealing with template
metaprogramming in C++, hygiene in OCaml, or domain-specific languages
in Clojure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think your idea &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be relevant to the workshop, please
don’t hesitate to contact Tom and myself. We’ll gladly give you
an honest assessment of whether your idea would be a good fit. If not,
we’ll do our best to direct you towards an appropriate venue for your
ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;who-should-submit&quot;&gt;Who should submit?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, submissions to Scheme Workshop come from those within
or adjacent to academia. However, this is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a requirement. We
welcome submissions from everyone who thinks they have something
thoughtful to say to the Scheme community. This year, I want to
specifically encourage submissions from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Undergraduate or graduate students who are looking for practice
writing papers on their own. It can be a challenge to develop your
own sense of research style. Scheme Workshop is a great place to get
feedback on your work in a low-stakes environment. Rather than judge
the quality of your work against a high technical bar, we want to
help build your ideas and presentation so that you can be proud of
the way you’re articulating them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People within the tech industry who have never written an academic
paper before. Scheme Workshop leans a bit more academic than
conferences such as RacketCon and StrangeLoop. However, this doesn’t
mean we don’t value ideas from industry. If you’re in industry and
would like to write a paper but aren’t sure how, please reach out to
me: I’m happy to Skype with you and speak frankly about how the
process works.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seasoned Scheme wizards. Scheme Workshop has a long history of
insightful talks from key contributors to the Scheme community. These
community members shape our vision, and guide newcomers (such as
myself!) by helping us understand the key principles that embody the
Scheme community.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;some-random-scheme-workshop-papers-i-liked&quot;&gt;Some random Scheme Workshop papers I liked&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s truly been some amazing work at Scheme Workshop over the
years.  I can’t hope to summarize it all here. Instead, I picked a
random collection of papers to help you get an idea of the workshop’s
direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://schemeworkshop.org/2006/15-barzilay.pdf&quot;&gt;A Self-Hosting Evaluator using
HOAS&lt;/a&gt;, by Eli
Barzilay. This paper discusses how–when you’re implementing a
Scheme interpreter in Scheme–you can avoid implementing
substitution by reflecting lambdas from the source language into the
metalangauge (which still gives you means of abstracting, e.g.,
control structure). This is a neat idea that is the perfect size for
Scheme Workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/03-mccarthy.pdf&quot;&gt;Interaction-Safe State for the
Web&lt;/a&gt; by Jay
McCarthy and Shriram Krishnamurthi. This paper discusses new
linguistic mechanisms for building abstractions for how we
understand navigation within web applications. I think this idea
nicely combines the practice of building web applications correctly
with the linguistic abstraction mechanisms afforded by Scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~robby/pubs/papers/scheme2007-wf.pdf&quot;&gt;Well-typed programs can’t be
blamed&lt;/a&gt;
by Philip Wadler and Robby Findler. This paper from 2007 appears to
be an earlier version of the highly influential 2009 ESOP paper of the
same name.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dherman/research/papers/scheme08-stack-marks.pdf&quot;&gt;Implementing Continuations Marks in
JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;
by John Clements, Ayswarya Sundaram, and David Herman. This paper
discusses how continuation marks can be implemented in JavaScript. I
see this as an exciting paper exploring a novel idea in a new space,
and the authors mention some foundational challenges in scaling up
to languages that allow tail calls with conventional “return”-style
semantics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~lkuper/papers/lambdae.pdf&quot;&gt;A pattern matcher for miniKanren–or–How to get into trouble with
CPS macros&lt;/a&gt;
by Andy Keep, Michael Adams, Lindsey Kuper, Will Byrd, and Dan
Friedman. This paper reveals an interesting ramification of writing
macros in a CPS-based style alongside conditional macro
expansion. They build a pattern matcher for the miniKanren
programming language, demonstrating the issue along the way. I like
that this paper reveals a foundational problem in macro engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;help-us-build-a-community&quot;&gt;Help us build a community!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of Scheme Workshop is to build a community that celebrates
the fun in presenting beautifully minimal ideas. We often masquerade
these ideas as programs. But we’re all bound together by the passion
we share for articulating our ideas in an elegant way. Programming
languages give us the ability to rapidly interact with our ideas,
breaking and rebuilding our realization of those ideas at a pace never
before seen by humanity. Scheme celebrates this opportunity by
allowing us unprecedented flexibility in the way we articulate and
execute these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that you share my excitement. If you do, I sincerely hope
you’ll consider submitting a paper to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thomas.gilray.org/scheme-2019/&quot;&gt;the twentieth workshop on
Scheme and Functional
Programming&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Does Netflix See my Facebook Picture?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The other day I updated my Facebook profile picture. The thing I
didn’t realize was that when I changed it, Netflix also got it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/facebook-netflix.png&quot; alt=&quot;A figure showing my Facebook profile picture on the left with an arrow pointing towards Netflix (getting my updated Facebook photo) on the right with a question mark over it (asking why)&quot; style=&quot;width:450px&quot; class=&quot;post-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is pretty jarring. Where was the “share this with Netflix” button
that I pressed? Of course, the answer is that it’s right here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/netflix-privacy.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture of Facebook's privacy configuration for Netflix&quot; style=&quot;width:350px&quot; class=&quot;post-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s buried right there under “Public profile (required).” But there’s
also a lot of other stuff I gave it access to too, I guess I forgot
about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why does it need access to my Facebook account at all? I just
wanted to use Facebook so that I wouldn’t have to login to Netflix
using an email. It’s so easy to just click in with my Facebook
account, it’s everywhere!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer, of course, is twofold: Netflix wants to give me a more
personalized experience (so they can beat out other video services)
and because they want to filter it into giant machine learning
algorithms to sell me ads and learn stuff about me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I knew all of that, but I &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; didn’t stop and think about
Netflix getting my new profile picture whenever I changed it. Wow. I
wonder what else does that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out it’s &lt;em&gt;hundreds&lt;/em&gt; of things! Facebook even has a tool for
this, called their “Privacy Checkup”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/facebook-privacy-checkup.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture of Facebook's privacy checkup tool&quot; style=&quot;width:400px&quot; class=&quot;post-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is useful for helping you audit which apps have access to do
things like post on your feed and things like that. But it doesn’t
show you more nuanced things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the big problem with all of this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There’s a gap between what Netflix is actually &lt;strong&gt;using&lt;/strong&gt;, and what I
think it &lt;strong&gt;needs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I think about Netflix using my Facebook, I think it’s just
because I’m logging on. But what I don’t see is that Netflix is using
so much more! It’s connecting me with my friends, looking at my likes,
and using that information to improve my experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what’s more, Netflix probably thinks that it’s okay to do this,
because after all, I agreed to it! And to be honest, they’re not
totally wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I build my mental model of what Netflix is accessing based on what
I &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; it doing, not the policy that I have to go read in a dark
corner of Facebook’s privacy section (no offense to Facebook).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;background-uses-are-tricky&quot;&gt;Background Uses Are Tricky&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I contend that the main problem here is that humans are very poor at
envisioning how apps will use our information in the “background.” The
background is a hazy thing, but by the background I basically mean,
“during a time at which I haven’t directly instructed the app to use
my information by an explicit interaction (e.g., pressing a button)”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans are very &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; at understanding that their information will be
used after taking some direct action. For example, after I click
“share location” it’s extremely obvious that my location will be
used. But we’re really bad at predicting (or remembering) what might
happen when it’s been six months since we installed the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s another example I noticed just today. I added some new contacts
to the phone book on my iPhone. Later, I went to use Skype. I’m not a
big fan of Skype: every other week it seems like someone’s Skype
account has been hacked, so I can’t say I have a huge amount of trust
in it. Of course, when Skype installed it basically forced me to allow
it to access my contacts. Okay, that seems sensible, so I let it. But
I didn’t realize that it would &lt;em&gt;constantly&lt;/em&gt; get my contacts whenever I
changed them. I allowed access, of course, but I didn’t really “see”
Skype accessing my contacts, so why would I be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found the same result in &lt;a href=&quot;http://kmicinski.com/assets/apptracer.pdf&quot;&gt;my CHI ‘17
paper&lt;/a&gt;, where we measured
user expectations of permission usage within a set of vignette Android
apps. Users were overwhelmingly more likely to expect access to
permissions after they took a direct action, but were much less likely
to expect that data was being accessed when that data was used in the
background. (I’ll be giving this talk again at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events-calendar/2018/02/privacycon-2018&quot;&gt;PrivacyCon
2018&lt;/a&gt;
later this year!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that was just for apps! Imagine how complicated it is when you’re
not just on your phone, you’re using some nebulous cloud-based
service. What’s worse: most apps have many different components,
interact with several different APIs (Facebook, Google, Twitter,
etc…), each of them using their own privacy GUIs that constantly
update and change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My frank guess is that users don’t really have any idea what’s
happening until they see it. In fact, in our CHI ‘17 paper we also
found that users are more likely to expect access when they see some
indication of it (e.g., a banner on the top of the screen associated
with the use of that permission, like a “free coffee at your local
MegaCoffee” coupon). But that’s not very satisfying: what about all of
the other data access they never even see?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;possible-solutions-better-defaults-reminders-and-audits&quot;&gt;Possible Solutions: Better Defaults, Reminders, and Audits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure what all of the answers are, but I have a few high-level
points that I take away from it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Users are very poor at reasoning about data access when the access
is far removed from the authorization decision.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They are even &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; when there’s no apparent &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt; why the
access occurs. In fact, this is almost downright
malicious. Permissions are only so coarse, and while Netflix has
access to a bunch of things in my “public profile”, I’d never expect
it to use all of them (even though I know it does).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We should educate users on how / why background uses occur, and
explain their relevance to app behavior if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we’re using coarse permissions, like “Public Profile”, we
should realize that users will only expect a subset of that data to
be used and act accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the first thing I think we can do is better defaults. For example,
Apple seems to have taken this hint. Apps can now simply request data
never and “when in use”. This is a pretty intuitive thing, since users
are pretty poor at conceptualizing the computational models of
apps. They also go a step further and show you this nice dialog when
apps have been using data in the background (I’m honestly not sure how
this occurs on iOS these days):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/ios-bg-loc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A picture showing how iOS alerts users to background location usage&quot; style=&quot;width:200px&quot; class=&quot;post-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is nice because it helps the user “audit” which apps have been
using their data. In our paper, we found that one concrete way to help
users understand background usage on Android was to ask for permission
right on startup before any other app functionality appeared. My
hypothesis is that users said “well the app hasn’t done anything yet,
so it must just need this all the time.” Still, I think that’s not a
very good compromise: users will tend to associate that the
information is only being used when the app appears to be using it. So
we should really confine data access to when users can observe it
happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another concrete way I see this improving is better auditing tools to
help users understand where their data will go. For example, I could
imagine implementing a tool that goes through your various social
networks and plays something like 20-questions with you: “do you know
that when you change your Facebook picture your FindMeSingles apps is
going to see it?” or something of the like. We’d need to do research
to help understand the best examples to present, but I think this
would be a cool idea since users reason well about examples and bad
about very general policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few research-y things I’m working on right now address this in a few
ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using dynamic analysis to measure when social media permissions are
being used in apps. We’re in the early stages of this (still
scraping apps from Google Play, let me know if you know of a better
way / a good way to get a bunch of apps!), but I think this will
provide some good ground truth on how apps are using these social
media permissions. Of course, there are limitations here. For
example, apps could pair with a web service to do the dirty work,
but I think this is a good first step.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Log-guided program analysis that helps analysts understand &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;
apps use permissions. Our tools use relatively cheap tricks to
enable (unsound) program analyses to scale to very large apps
(Bumble, Tinder, Slack) and precisely explain why permissions are
used. We do this by using &lt;em&gt;logs&lt;/em&gt; from those programs to guide the
analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Analysis-based support for lowering the performance overhead of
dynamic information-flow analyses. Since many web systems are
written using dynamic languages (e.g., Python), I’m excited about
the possibilities of using off-the-shelf tools (like
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jeanqasaur/jeeves&quot;&gt;Jeeves&lt;/a&gt;) to specify
information-flow policies that connect up to the GUI in a principled
way (similar to what I did in &lt;a href=&quot;http://kmicinski.com/assets/clickrelease.pdf&quot;&gt;my ESORICS ‘15
paper&lt;/a&gt;). The problem
with these systems is that they do induce some runtime overhead, but
we’re hoping to eliminate much of that by using intelligent program
analysis techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Longer-term, I’m interested in driving my research to understand how
users conceptualize these permissions. What does that say about how we
can visualize and enforce them? I’m specifically interested in
cross-app policies: where the data goes from the camera app on your
phone, to Instagram, to your friend’s parents after your friend clicks
“like” on the image (and their parents then see it in their
feed). These decisions are nuanced, and seem especially hard to
explain to users. But as we have more and more apps, I think getting a
handle on these things will be essential. And once we do that, we can
(hopefully) start using cool language-based techniques to help enforce
these policies!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Video: Exploiting Use After Free (UAF) vulnerabilities</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obligatory&lt;/strong&gt;: I must point out that my inspiration for this post was
a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHghwsTRyzQ&quot;&gt;really nice video on
YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t claim
to have invented this idea, I just wanted to explain it in a way that
makes sense to me (although the YouTuber likely does a better job than
I).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today in my class we talked a bit about memory safety and
allocation. We’ve talked a decent amount about pointers, but haven’t
had any projects where students are required to use
allocation. Instead, we’re (so far) relying on RAII from library
classes to get students through their programming. My suspcion is that
students are probably too eager to use pointers without understandign
their vagaries, because that’s what I did when I started programming
in C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as a bit of fun (and preparation for my course next semester), I
made a video showing how these vulnerabilities work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kmicinski/cmsc245examples/blob/master/c%2B%2B/uaf.cc&quot;&gt;link to the code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Job materials for 2017</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m applying to colleges and universities again in 2017. I’m very
happy at Haverford, but I’m on the lookout for a tenure-track spot at
a place that has students and colleagues that will excite me in the
same way I’m feeling right now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/research.pdf&quot;&gt;My research statement (4 12-point pages)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/teaching.pdf&quot;&gt;My teaching statement (2 12-point pages)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

        <title>All About Git</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m giving a college-wide talk for FIG (Fig is Good) tonight. FIG is a
student computing group. I’m hoping to record the talk, but for now
I’ll just put the slides here.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My new cybersecurity course at Haverford (Spring 2017)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You can also download this syllabus as a &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/cybersec-syllabus.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-security-attacks-and-defenses&quot;&gt;Computer Security: Attacks and Defenses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;CMSC 323&lt;/em&gt; at Haverford)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Experience in C programming:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;E.g., CMSC245 at Haverford or CMSC246 at Bryn Mawr&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Experience with or willingness to learn learn new languages (Python, SQL, JavaScript, etc..)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workload&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 lecture hours per week&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 lab hour per week&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This will be a lab / project intensive class. Approximately 6-10
hours per week &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; of class will be expected from
students. I recommend against taking this course concurrent with
other project-heavy courses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cap&lt;/strong&gt;: 25 (may be lifted to 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;course-overview&quot;&gt;Course Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This​ ​course​ ​will​ ​serve​ ​as​ ​a​ ​broad​ ​introduction​ ​to​ ​the​ ​field​ ​of​
​computer​ ​security,​ ​from​ ​two concurrent​ ​perspectives:​ ​attacks​ ​on​
​systems,​ ​and​ ​defenses​ ​against​ ​those​ ​attacks.​ ​The​ ​goal​ ​of this​ ​course​
​will​ ​be​ ​to​ ​help​ ​build​ ​intuition​ ​so​ ​that–when​ ​designing​ ​your​ ​own​
​systems–you​ ​can intelligently​ ​assess​ ​and​ ​mitigate​ ​security​ ​risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To​ ​understand​ ​how​ ​attackers​ ​think,​ ​we​ ​will​ ​learn​ ​about​ ​the​ ​attacks​
​they​ ​employ.​ ​​ ​We​ ​will dissect​ ​a​ ​number​ ​of​ ​real-world​ ​attacks​ ​(such​ ​as​
​Heartbleed​ ​or​ ​WannaCry)​ ​and​ ​reflect​ ​upon​ ​what could​ ​have​ ​been​ ​done​ ​to​
​prevent​ ​them.​ ​But​ ​understanding​ ​a​ ​collection​ ​of​ ​attacks​ ​is​ ​not​ ​alone
sufficient​ ​for​ ​helping​ ​us​ ​understand​ ​how​ ​to​ ​build​ ​secure​ ​systems.​ ​So​
​alongside​ ​attacks,​ ​we​ ​will also​ ​learn​ ​the​ ​theoretical​ ​underpinnings​
​of​ ​security,​ ​and​ ​use​ ​it​ ​to​ ​build​ ​defenses​ ​into​ ​our systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Labs​ ​will​ ​transition​ ​theory​ ​into​ ​practice.​ ​We​ ​will​ ​conclude​ ​with​ ​a​
​group​ ​project​ ​exploring advanced​ ​topics​ ​relevant​ ​to​ ​the​ ​state​ ​of​ ​the​
​art​ ​in​ ​computer​ ​security.​ ​The​ ​course​ ​will​ ​begin​ ​with a​ ​discussion​ ​on​
​ethical​ ​application​ ​of​ ​techniques​ ​we​ ​learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;topics&quot;&gt;Topics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We​ ​will​ ​cover​ ​parts​ ​of​ ​the​ ​following​ ​topics,​ ​adjusted​ ​for​ ​time​ ​and​ ​pace​ ​of​ ​the​ ​course,​ ​along​ ​with
student​ ​interest​ ​in​ ​each​ ​area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Low-level​ ​memory​ ​attacks​ ​and​ ​defenses
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Buffer​ ​overflows&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Stack​ ​canaries&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Access​ ​space​ ​randomization​ ​/​ ​derandomization&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Return​ ​to​ ​libc​ ​/​ ​return-oriented-programming&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cryptography
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Symmetric and asymmetric-key cryptography&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Certificates, CAs, and​ ​PKI&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;SSL/TLS&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Web security
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;SQL​ ​injections&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Cross-site​ ​scripting&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Cross-site​ ​request​ ​forgery&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Social​ ​engineering​ ​and​ ​security​ ​ethics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;UI​ ​design​ ​for​ ​security
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;App​ ​permissions​ ​design&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Best​ ​practices​ ​for​ ​security​ ​UI&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Permission​ ​lifetime​ ​and​ ​revocation&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Case​ ​study​ ​in​ ​privacy​ ​controls:
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Facebook​ ​privacy​ ​controls&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Android​ ​permissions&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Information​ ​flow​ ​control​ ​in​ ​web​ ​apps&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reverse​ ​engineering&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Theoretical​ ​underpinnings​ ​of​ ​security
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Full​ ​abstraction&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Information​ ​flow&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;projects-and-labs&quot;&gt;Projects and Labs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Projects​ ​will​ ​be​ ​started​ ​in​ ​labs,​ ​and​ ​then​ ​continued​ ​individually.​
​Some​ ​labs​ ​are​ ​structured​ ​so​ ​that they​ ​begin​ ​with​ ​a​ ​concrete​
​assignment​ ​to​ ​work​ ​on​ ​as​ ​an​ ​individual​ ​in​ ​the​ ​first​ ​week,​ ​and​ ​then
move​ ​on​ ​to​ ​a​ ​group​ ​assignment​ ​to​ ​complete​ ​a​ ​larger​ ​task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;project-1-memory-attacks-weeks-1-4-inclusive-uses-c-programming&quot;&gt;Project 1: Memory attacks (Weeks 1-4 inclusive) (Uses C programming)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This​ ​project​ ​will​ ​cover​ ​low-level​ ​memory​ ​attacks​ ​using​ ​the​ ​C​
​programming​ ​language.​ ​The students​ ​will​ ​begin​ ​by​ ​executing​ ​an​ ​attack​
​from​ ​starter​ ​code​ ​provided.​ ​They​ ​will​ ​then​ ​implement their​ ​own​ ​buffer​
​overflow​ ​attack,​ ​and​ ​demonstrate​ ​a​ ​way​ ​to​ ​prevent​ ​the​ ​attack​ ​by​
​intelligent programming,​ ​and​ ​also​ ​facilities​ ​provided​ ​by​ ​the​
​compiler.​ ​After​ ​completing​ ​this​ ​task,​ ​students will​ ​form​ ​groups​ ​to​
​complete​ ​a​ ​more​ ​advanced​ ​attack​ ​studying​ ​ASLR​ ​or​ ​ROP.​ ​1.5​ ​weeks​ ​will​
​be allocated​ ​for​ ​independent​ ​programming,​ ​and​ ​1.5​ ​weeks​ ​will​ ​be​
​allocated​ ​for​ ​group​ ​work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;project-2-cryptography-weeks-4-7-incl-uses-python-programming&quot;&gt;Project 2: Cryptography (weeks 4-7 incl.) (Uses Python programming)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This​ ​project​ ​will​ ​involve​ ​creating​ ​a​ ​public​ ​/​ ​private​ ​key​ ​pair​ ​and​
​manually​ ​exchanging​ ​keys​ ​to collaborate​ ​secretly​ ​communicate​ ​with​
​group​ ​members.​ ​The​ ​next​ ​week,​ ​students​ ​will​ ​either implement​ ​a​ ​secure​
​chat​ ​using​ ​cryptographic​ ​primitives​ ​provided,​ ​or​ ​explore​ ​an​ ​attack​ ​on​
​an insecure​ ​cryptographic​ ​hash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;project-3-web-security-weeks-7-9-incl-uses-python-programming&quot;&gt;Project 3: Web security (weeks 7-9 incl.) (Uses Python programming)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students​ ​will​ ​be​ ​given​ ​an​ ​insecure​ ​web​ ​app​ ​written​ ​in​ ​Python​ ​which​ ​is​
​vulnerable​ ​to​ ​an​ ​SQL injection​ ​attack.​ ​They​ ​will​ ​then​ ​craft​ ​an​ ​input​
​which​ ​causes​ ​the​ ​app​ ​to​ ​leak​ ​secret​ ​information​ ​(in this​ ​case,​
​student​ ​grades​ ​from​ ​a​ ​synthetic​ ​gradebook​ ​consisting​ ​of​ ​fictitious​
​students).​ ​They​ ​will then​ ​fix​ ​this​ ​attack​ ​in​ ​the​ ​app.​ ​Finally,​
​students​ ​will​ ​attempt​ ​to​ ​break​ ​other​ ​students’​ ​fixes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;final-project-weeks-10-14&quot;&gt;Final project (weeks 10-14):&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This​ ​will​ ​be​ ​a​ ​final​ ​project,​ ​either​ ​in​ ​a​ ​group​ ​or​ ​alone.​ ​Students​ ​requesting​ ​to​ ​work​ ​alone​ ​need
prior​ ​approval​ ​for​ ​a​ ​topic​ ​and​ ​expectations​ ​will​ ​be​ ​calibrated​ ​accordingly.​ ​Students​ ​will​ ​select
one​ ​of​ ​the​ ​following​ ​projects,​ ​or​ ​propose​ ​their​ ​own​ ​project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Information flow specification (uses Python/Jeeves)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Implement​ ​privacy​ ​policies​ ​for​ ​a​ ​secure​ ​student​ ​grades​ ​database​
​using​ ​Jeeves,​ ​an extension​ ​to​ ​the​ ​Python​ ​programming​ ​language.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Designing a privacy UI (uses Python / Javascript / etc..)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Use​ ​best​ ​practices​ ​to​ ​propose​ ​and​ ​implement​ ​a​ ​new​ ​UI​ ​for​ ​some​ ​privacy-related
mechanism,​ ​and​ ​perform​ ​a​ ​mock​ ​implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Malware reverse engineering&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Use​ ​reverse​ ​engineering​ ​tools​ ​to​ ​understand​ ​and​ ​discuss​ ​how​ ​a​
​particular​ ​piece​ ​of malware​ ​works.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implement signature-based antivirus&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Students​ ​will​ ​read​ ​about​ ​and​ ​implement​ ​a​ ​variant​ ​of​ ​signature-based​
​antivirus​ ​detection for​ ​a​ ​small​ ​sample​ ​of​ ​malware.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students​ ​will​ ​check​ ​in​ ​with​ ​the​ ​professor​ ​regularly,​ ​and​
collaboration​ ​will​ ​occur​ ​via​ ​Github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;grading&quot;&gt;Grading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Labs and projects: 50%
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Individual component: 30%&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Group component: 20%&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two midterm exams: 30% (take home and open note)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Given 1/3rd and 2/3rd of the way through the course&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Final project: 20%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evaluation​ ​for​ ​group​ ​projects​ ​will​ ​be​ ​based​ ​on​ ​mutual​ ​student​
feedback​ ​and​ ​oral​ ​exam​ ​with individual​ ​group​ ​members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;books&quot;&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Required&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Writing tip: say the text back to you</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s the tip: have your computer read your writing back to
you. Listen to how it sounds. Then, iterate until it conveys what
you’d like to hear. On a mac, you can do this it like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;say -r words_per_minute &quot;My speech goes here&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do this to either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read the text back to me quickly (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-r 240-270&lt;/code&gt;). This helps follow
along with a document in front of me and check it for flow. It also
catches miswordings, (some) grammar errors, and typos.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Close my eyes, sit back, and really try to absorb the text. I listen
slowly, around 180-200 words per minute. This allows me to hear
places where the text sounds awkward or redundant.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/BUGS-Writing-Revised-Guide-Debugging/dp/020137921X&quot;&gt;BUGS in
Writing&lt;/a&gt;
talks at length about developing an “ear” for good writing. While I
found the book’s content useful, it’s decidedly hard to be able to
objectively “hear” your own writing. I have a tough time divorcing the
process of reading from pondering over the endless ways I could
improve any given sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve found that listening to the text spoken back to you is a great
way to perform rapid prototyping on documents. For example, I wrote a
rough draft of this post, listened to it, and then restructured based
on what I heard. I don’t think of myself as a naturally good
writer. Forcing myself to slow down and concentrate naturally shifts
my sentences towards being shorter and more concise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example from the syllabus for my upcoming security course,
which I was editing today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To understand how attackers think, we will learn about the attacks
they employ. But understanding a collection of attacks is not alone
sufficient for helping us understand how to build secure systems. So
alongside attacks, we will also cover the theory behind building
defenses into our systems. We will dissect a number of real-world
attacks (such as Heartbleed or WannaCry) and reflect upon what could
have been done to prevent them. To complement these examples, will
learn the theoretical underpinnings of security that apply across
systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent some amount of time going over this text, but never really
“heard” it all together. When I did, I immediately identified the
problem: the paragraph was saying the same thing twice, breaking the
natural flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then came up with this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To understand how attackers think, we will learn about the attacks
they employ. We will dissect a number of real-world attacks (such as
Heartbleed or WannaCry) and reflect upon what could have been done
to prevent them. But understanding a collection of attacks is not
alone sufficient for helping us understand how to build secure
systems. So alongside attacks, we will also learn the theoretical
underpinnings of security, and use it to build defenses into our
systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which sounds a lot better to me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, I learned this trick from Philip Guo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Do other people do this too? I often use text-to-speech to have my computer/phone read my own writing back to me to sense how it sounds&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Philip Guo (@pgbovine) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pgbovine/status/910182577767514113&quot;&gt;September 19, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Here: Have Some PLUM Scrum</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is about transparency with your advisor. It seems like most
problems that PhD students face boil down to communication and
transparency: students work on something the advisor doesn’t expect,
the advisor has different expectations for number of papers required
to graduate, student collaborates with someone when the advisor
doesn’t expect them to, etc…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/PL/&quot;&gt;PLUM group&lt;/a&gt; at UMD uses a
scrum-style approach to managing research called “PL status.” There’s
a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mwh/papers/score.pdf&quot;&gt;nice paper&lt;/a&gt; my advisor
and Mike Hicks wrote up about this approach that details it, but I can
tell you what it is right now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have everyone meet for 15 minutes three times each week&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stand up and talk about what you did, what you’re doing, and what you’re going to do&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Highlight problems you’re having and arrange to meet offline if necessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I view the PLUM-scrum as one way to address the issue of transparency
between advisors and advisees. It’s not a silver bullet: there have
been times when I skipped status for a while, or would kind of
reiterate the same vague and high level thing for a few days. But when
applied correctly and honestly, I think it helps students and advisors
feel on the same page. Obviously for long term disagreements on
vision, something longer than a 15 minute meeting will be
required. But I think even here the scrum approach pays off, since it
helps break down the barriers that eventually fester and cause
advisors and advisees to feel like they don’t communicate correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One problem I see among my peer grad students (outside of PL) is that
they gradually grow a little distant. This is natural: advisors get
overwhelmed with responsibilities and it’s easy to simply assume your
(probably very bright) PhD student is doing the right thing and making
progress. After all, PhD school is about learning how to do research,
and some of that has to be about independent thought and
development. The scrum approach helps correct this by requiring
students and advisors to maintain some consistent level of
plugged-in-ness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continually see grad students who say something along the lines of
“well, my advisor doesn’t really know what I’m doing right now.” This
is fine, if it works, but what happens when the grad student has
problems? What if they end up working on an area that doesn’t pan out?
Or write a paper that ends up being scooped? My theory is that if
there’s transparency between the student and advisor, at least they’ll
be able to understand what went wrong, and how to improve it in the
future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure there are tons of ways to maintain transparency between
advisors and advisees, but the PLUM-scrum seems to be a fairly
lightweight (45 minutes a week for all students) way to do this that
offers high potential rewards: catch problems early, mutual assurance
that advisors and students are working together, and a more cohesive
group dynamic to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you could try suggesting this to your advisor&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Appreciating Research as Problems</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I reflected on the kinds of problems I’ve worked on during my
PhD, and in doing so realized that I likely did not fully appreciate
what research was until rather recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research is about identifying and solving novel, important, and
generalizable problems inherent in nature. Looking back on the
problems I’ve solved for my PhD, I realize that I might have (at the
time) confused the &lt;em&gt;methods&lt;/em&gt; used to tackle the research with the
research itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this conflation is easy for any student to make, because it is
the natural conclusion of the path you take before you start your
PhD. In undergrad, you struggle (and succeed!) to understand complex
technical devices used to solve problems. For example, a CS major may
learn proof mechanisms such as the pumping lemma, diagonalization, or
proof by structural induction. It feels natural upon starting your PhD
to assume that research will be challenging in a similar way. For me,
this was exacerbated by the fact that I saw so many technical devices
used in research that I hadn’t encountered in my undergrad: things
like Coq, category theory, and abstract interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of seeing these things, it feels natural to assume that the
road to doing good research is climbing the mountain of concepts until
you get to the hardest one you can find, and to keep working on
it. For example, I assumed that CS research entailed extending Coq,
category theory, or abstract interpretation. This is partially true
(in fact, these are areas of research), but taking this viewpoint
leaves out a large amount of equally (or more) important vision of
research that merely leverages those techniques to explore some other
problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout my PhD I was challenged by this misconception, and I think
if I had identified it earlier on I could have done even more (and
better) research. In particular, confusing the techniques used to
accomplish research with problems proper leads to a very limited set
of problems to solve. Worse: it leads to problems that have been well
explored by many people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I realized that the quality of research was not determined
by the complexity of the mechanics, but instead the merit of the
problem itself. Instead of judging problems by how much math (or code,
or person-hours, etc..) would be required to accomplish them, I judge
problems by how clearly they identify a disjoint area of study which
may not have been obvious previously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking this viewpoint has a large set of positive consequences:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can stop worrying that you aren’t smart enough to solve
problems. Research is about identifying useful problems, but useful
problems don’t have to be challenging per se. Of course, figuring
out how to distill a complex problem into simple pieces is often
exactly the challenging part of research.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can start with a question I care about and find interesting
technical work by assessing the gap between the current technical
solutions and my problem.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My research interests branch out beyond a subfield of computer
science to expand to all of science as a whole. Instead of viewing
myself as someone who works on problems X, Y, and Z, I can view
myself as someone who works on problems, and is influenced by (but
does not exclusively use) X, Y, and Z.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking this viewpoint of research has also helped contextualize the
research I have done into a broader narrative of what I think of as
the set of problems I care about.&lt;/p&gt;
