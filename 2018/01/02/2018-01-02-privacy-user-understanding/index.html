<p>The other day I updated my Facebook profile picture. The thing I
didn’t realize was that when I changed it, Netflix also got it:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>![A figure showing my Facebook profile picture on the left with an arrow pointing towards Netflix (getting my updated Facebook photo) on the right with a question mark over it (asking why)](/assets/facebook-netflix.png){:width="400px",:class="img-centered"}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is pretty jarring. Where was the “share this with Netflix” button
that I pressed? Of course, the answer is that it’s right here:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/netflix-privacy.png" alt="A picture of Facebook's privacy configuration for Netflix" /></p>

<p>It’s buried right there under “Public profile (required).” But there’s
also a lot of other stuff I gave it access to too, I guess I forgot
about that.</p>

<p>But why does it need access to my Facebook account at all? I just
wanted to use Facebook so that I wouldn’t have to login to Netflix
using an email. It’s so easy to just click in with my Facebook
account, it’s everywhere!</p>

<p>The answer, of course, is twofold: Netflix wants to give me a more
personalized experience (so they can beat out other video services)
and because they want to filter it into giant machine learning
algorithms to sell me ads and learn stuff about me.</p>

<p>So I knew all of that, but I <em>still</em> didn’t stop and think about
Netflix getting my new profile picture whenever I changed it. Wow. I
wonder what else does that!</p>

<p>Turns out it’s <em>hundreds</em> of things! Facebook even has a tool for
this, called their “Privacy Checkup”:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/facebook-privacy-checkup.png" alt="A picture of Facebook's privacy checkup tool" /></p>

<p>This is useful for helping you audit which apps have access to do
things like post on your feed and things like that. But it doesn’t
show you more nuanced things.</p>

<p>Here’s the big problem with all of this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s a gap between what Netflix is actually <strong>using</strong>, and what I
think it <strong>needs</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I think about Netflix using my Facebook, I think it’s just
because I’m logging on. But what I don’t see is that Netflix is using
so much more! It’s connecting me with my friends, looking at my likes,
and using that information to improve my experience.</p>

<p>And what’s more, Netflix probably thinks that it’s okay to do this,
because after all, I agreed to it! And to be honest, they’re not
totally wrong.</p>

<p>But I build my mental model of what Netflix is accessing based on what
I <em>see</em> it doing, not the policy that I have to go read in a dark
corner of Facebook’s privacy section (no offense to Facebook).</p>

<h2 id="background-uses-are-tricky">Background Uses Are Tricky</h2>

<p>I contend that the main problem here is that humans are very poor at
envisioning how apps will use our information in the “background.” The
background is a hazy thing, but by the background I basically mean,
“during a time at which I haven’t directly instructed the app to use
my information by an explicit interaction (e.g., pressing a button)”</p>

<p>Humans are very <em>good</em> at understanding that their information will be
used after taking some direct action. For example, after I click
“share location” it’s extremely obvious that my location will be
used. But we’re really bad at predicting (or remembering) what might
happen when it’s been six months since we installed the app.</p>

<p>Here’s another example I noticed just today. I added some new contacts
to the phone book on my iPhone. Later, I went to use Skype. I’m not a
big fan of Skype: every other week it seems like someone’s Skype
account has been hacked, so I can’t say I have a huge amount of trust
in it. Of course, when Skype installed it basically forced me to allow
it to access my contacts. Okay, that seems sensible, so I let it. But
I didn’t realize that it would <em>constantly</em> get my contacts whenever I
changed them. I allowed access, of course, but I didn’t really “see”
Skype accessing my contacts, so why would I be surprised.</p>

<p>We found the same result in <a href="http://kmicinski.com/assets/apptracer.pdf">my CHI ‘17
paper</a>, where we measured
user expectations of permission usage within a set of vignette Android
apps. Users were overwhelmingly more likely to expect access to
permissions after they took a direct action, but were much less likely
to expect that data was being accessed when that data was used in the
background. (I’ll be giving this talk again at <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events-calendar/2018/02/privacycon-2018">PrivacyCon
2018</a>
later this year!)</p>

<p>And that was just for apps! Imagine how complicated it is when you’re
not just on your phone, you’re using some nebulous cloud-based
service. What’s worse: most apps have many different components,
interact with several different APIs (Facebook, Google, Twitter,
etc…), each of them using their own privacy GUIs that constantly
update and change.</p>

<p>My frank guess is that users don’t really have any idea what’s
happening until they see it. In fact, in our CHI ‘17 paper we also
found that users are more likely to expect access when they see some
indication of it (e.g., a banner on the top of the screen associated
with the use of that permission, like a “free coffee at your local
MegaCoffee” coupon). But that’s not very satisfying: what about all of
the other data access they never even see?</p>

<h2 id="possible-solutions-better-defaults-reminders-and-audits">Possible Solutions: Better Defaults, Reminders, and Audits</h2>

<p>I’m not sure what all of the answers are, but I have a few high-level
points that I take away from it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Users are very poor at reasoning about data access when the access
is far removed from the authorization decision.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are even <em>worse</em> when there’s no apparent <em>reason</em> why the
access occurs. In fact, this is almost downright
malicious. Permissions are only so coarse, and while Netflix has
access to a bunch of things in my “public profile”, I’d never expect
it to use all of them (even though I know it does).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should educate users on how / why background uses occur, and
explain their relevance to app behavior if possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we’re using coarse permissions, like “Public Profile”, we
should realize that users will only expect a subset of that data to
be used and act accordingly.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So the first thing I think we can do is better defaults. For example,
Apple seems to have taken this hint. Apps can now simply request data
never and “when in use”. This is a pretty intuitive thing, since users
are pretty poor at conceptualizing the computational models of
apps. They also go a step further and show you this nice dialog when
apps have been using data in the background (I’m honestly not sure how
this occurs on iOS these days):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/ios-bg-loc.jpg" alt="A picture showing how iOS alerts users to background location usage" /></p>

<p>This is nice because it helps the user “audit” which apps have been
using their data. In our paper, we found that one concrete way to help
users understand background usage on Android was to ask for permission
right on startup before any other app functionality appeared. My
hypothesis is that users said “well the app hasn’t done anything yet,
so it must just need this all the time.” Still, I think that’s not a
very good compromise: users will tend to associate that the
information is only being used when the app appears to be using it. So
we should really confine data access to when users can observe it
happening.</p>

<p>Another concrete way I see this improving is better auditing tools to
help users understand where their data will go. For example, I could
imagine implementing a tool that goes through your various social
networks and plays something like 20-questions with you: “do you know
that when you change your Facebook picture your FindMeSingles apps is
going to see it?” or something of the like. We’d need to do research
to help understand the best examples to present, but I think this
would be a cool idea since users reason well about examples and bad
about very general policies.</p>

<p>My research right now works on a few different facets of this problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Using dynamic analysis to measure when social media permissions are
being used in apps. We’re in the early stages of this (still
scraping apps from Google Play, let me know if you know of a better
way / a good way to get a bunch of apps!), but I think this will
provide some good ground truth on how apps are using these social
media permissions. Of course, there are limitations here. For
example, apps could pair with a web service to do the dirty work,
but I think this is a good first step.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Log-guided program analysis that helps analysts understand <em>why</em>
apps use permissions. Our tools use relatively cheap tricks to
enable (unsound) program analyses to scale to very large apps
(Bumble, Tinder, Slack) and precisely explain why permissions are
used. We do this by using <em>logs</em> from those programs to guide the
analysis.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Analysis-based support for lowering the performance overhead of
dynamic information-flow analyses. Since many web systems are
written using dynamic languages (e.g., Python), I’m excited about
the possibilities of using off-the-shelf tools (like
<a href="https://github.com/jeanqasaur/jeeves">Jeeves</a>) to specify
information-flow policies that connect up to the GUI in a principled
way (similar to what I did in <a href="http://kmicinski.com/assets/clickrelease.pdf">my ESORICS ‘15
paper</a>). The problem
with these systems is that they do induce some runtime overhead, but
we’re hoping to eliminate much of that by using intelligent program
analysis techniques.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Longer-term, I’m interested in driving my research to understand how
users conceptualize these permissions, and what that says about how we
can visualize and enforce them. I’m specifically interested in
cross-app policies: where the data goes from the camera app on your
phone, to Instagram, to your friend’s parents after your friend clicks
“like” on the image (and their parents then see it in their
feed). These decisions are nuanced, and seem especially hard to
explain to users. But as we have more and more apps, I think getting a
handle on these things will be essential. And once we do that, we can
(hopefully) start using cool language-based techniques to help enforce
these policies!</p>
