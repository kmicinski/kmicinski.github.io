<p><em>Obligatory: I must point out that my inspiration for this post was a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHghwsTRyzQ">really nice video on
YouTube</a>. I don’t claim
to have invented this idea, I just wanted to explain it in a way that
makes sense to me (although the YouTuber likely does a better job than
I).</em></p>

<p>Today in my class we talked a bit about memory safety and
allocation. We’ve talked a decent amount about pointers, but haven’t
had any projects where students are required to use
allocation. Instead, we’re (so far) relying on RAII from library
classes to get students through their programming. My suspcion is that
students are probably too eager to use pointers without understandign
their vagaries, because that’s what I did when I started programming
in C.</p>

<p>So as a bit of fun (and preparation for my course next semester), I
made a video showing how these vulnerabilities work.</p>
