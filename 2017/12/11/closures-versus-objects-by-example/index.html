<p>Objects seem to be relatively intuitive to understand: there are
member variables and methods that act on those member
variables. Simple. When I was a student, closures always seemed a bit
more nebuolous to me. There was some hazy notion that they were kind
of the same thing, which didn’t really make sense to me until I
thought about it a bit more. So let’s see a concrete example
demonstrating the difference between closures and objects.</p>

<p>The high-level story here is that closures and objects are both a way
to represent code plus data:</p>
