  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>My undergraduate programming languages course is structured around
teaching operational semantics. For several years, I have been
pondering how to motivate and properly explain type theory and its
operational interpretation. Here I have some notes from my course this
semester, which I hope to expand into videos (as with the rest of my
undergraduate course) over the coming weeks.</p>

<h2 id="simply-typed-λ-calculus-stlc">Simply-Typed λ-Calculus (STLC)</h2>

<p>The Simply-Typed λ-Calculus (STLC) is a type system that allows
proving safety properties of the calling conventions of terms in the λ
calculus. A type system is a set of rules that defines how an
“annotated” program may be constructed. The annotations stipulate
types for each subexpression of the program: the type system (more
specifically the definition of the typing derivation) tells us how to
check this fully-annotated program is constructed correctly.  Assumingi 
it is, you will get a certain guarantee of a safety property of the
program: that it is “type correct” and does not crash due to a type
error, for example. As we will see, the notion of “type correct” can
be arbitrarily complex–so as to encode complex logical formulas
encoding, for example, a statement that an expression’s result
satisfies some functional guarantee.</p>

<p>I will start by assume knowledge of the untyped λ-calculus. For our
purposes here, the untyped λ-calculus is a small, Turing-equivalent
model of computation consisting of only applications <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(e0 e1)</code> and
abstractions <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(λ (x) e)</code> over variables <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code>—binding is often (but
not always) handled via substitution, the model I present in my class
(other encodings, including De Bruijn indices, also exist–I ignore
them here). The only value (runtime object) in the language is a λ,
operationalized via a closure or some similar mechanism.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(define (expr? e)
  (match e
    ;; Variables
    [(? symbol? x) #t]
    ;; Literals
    [(? bool-lit? b) #t]
    [(? int-lit? i) #t]
    ;; Applications
    [`(,(? expr? e0) ,(? expr? e1)) #t]
    ;; Annotated expressions
    [`(,(? expr? e) : ,(? type? t)) #t]
    ;; Anotated lambdas
    [`(lambda (,(? symbol? x) : ,(? type? t)) ,(? expr? e)) #t]))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can only do one interesting operation in the λ-calculus: calling
functions. There is only one thing that can go wrong when we call a
function: that there is no function to call. For example, notice that
the following term crashes in Racket:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>((λ (f) ((f (λ (a) a)) (λ (a) a))) (λ (z) 1))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we envision that all functions in our language have been curried,
we can construe the call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f</code> as a (curried) application <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f</code> on two
arguments; the program crashes because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f</code> is then bound to a function
of a single argument: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(λ (z) 1)</code>. The same thing occurs in the
λ-calculus if we just change <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> to a free variable; we can’t evaluate
non-closed λ-calculus terms in Racket, but the underlying issue is the
same.</p>

<p>We want to ensure a global invariant: at every call site <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(e0 e1)</code>,
the set of values that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">e0</code> computes must always be functions (rather
than, say, free variables). More generally, if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(e0 e1 ... en)</code> is a
callsite, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">e0</code> must be a function of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> arguments. Of course the
challenge is that, in a higher-order language, it is (in general)
impossible to know precisely which syntactic functions reach <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">e0</code>: if
we knew precisely which lambdas <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">e0</code> could be, we could just manually
inspect all of them to ensure they were of the appropriate arity. This
is impossible to perfectly predict, as being able to do so implies a
solution to the halting problem (is the following program safe? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">((if
(program-halts expr) (lambda (x) x) (lambda (x y) x)) 1)</code>).</p>

<p>To make the problem tractable, STLC will take a more conservative
approach. Every subexpression in the program is annotated with a
<em>type</em>, which constrains its behavior. There are two base types I will
discuss here: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bool</code>. The precise base types are unimportant
and a parameter of the system, but they are useful for examples and I
will assume some basic operations such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">is-zero?</code>. Next,
there are <em>arrow</em> types, which are the types of functions. If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T1</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T2</code> are types, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T1 -&gt; T2</code> is also a type, and is the type of
functions from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T1</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T2</code>. Arrow types are formed by λ abstractions
such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(λ (a) a)</code>, but crucially, in STLC all binders explicitly
constrain their argument to be of a specific type, so the full form is
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(λ (a : T) a)</code>.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>;; Types for STLC
(define (type? t)
  (match t
    ;; Base types: int and bool
    ['int #t]
    ['bool #t]
    ;; Arrow types: t0 -&gt; t1
    [`(,(? type? t0) -&gt; ,(? type? t1)) #t]
    [_ #f]))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s look at some example expressions and their types:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>;; The type of an integer 
(23 : int)
;; The type of a function from from int to int
(lambda (x : int) x)
;; The type of a function whose input type is int -&gt; int
;; and whose output type is bool -&gt; bool
(lambda (x : int -&gt; int) (lambda (y : bool) y)) 
  : ((int -&gt; int) -&gt; (bool -&gt; bool))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In my presentation here, I allow any expression to be <em>explicitly</em>
annotated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(e : t)</code>. While it is very ugly, it is sometimes
semantically-helpful to construe STLC terms in this fully-annotated
representation. Here are some more examples:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>((lambda (x : int) (x : int)) : int -&gt; int)

(((lambda (f : int -&gt; (int -&gt; int)) ((f : int) (3 : int))) 
  : (int -&gt; (int -&gt; int)) -&gt; (int -&gt; int))
 ((lambda (x : int) (lambda (y : int) y)) : (int -&gt; (int -&gt; int))))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Most of the time, these terms are written as the less-obnoxious:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>((lambda (x : int) x) 

(((lambda (f : int -&gt; (int -&gt; int)) (f 3)))
 ((lambda (x : int) (lambda (y : int) y))))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is because our mind quickly becomes adept at inferring the
missing types from the surrounding contextual information, provided
the arguments of λs are annotated. This is a subtle point, but is of
crucial importance to STLC: once we know the argument types for λ
abstractions, the rest of the types fall into place, assuming the
expression is typeable at all. We will see next how this leads to a
“syntax-directed” algorithm, but it is instructive to carry on this
fully-explicit style for a while, as it leads to a nice understanding
of the typing derivation itself as a strict syntactic extension of the
original program.</p>

<p>Here are the typing rules for STLC (I leave out booleans, they are
also constants and handled similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code>s).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/stlc.png" alt="Typing Rules for STLC" /></p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Const</code> rule tells us that any literal integer constant in the
program can be immediately said to have the type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code>. The types of
variables is tracked via a map Γ, a (partial) function from variables
to their associated types. An implementation would likely implement
this using a hashmap, HAMT, or similar immutable dictionary. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Var</code>
rule says that if x is a syntactic variable, and Γ(x) = t, then it is
allowed to say x has type x under the context Γ. Notice that the
notation in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Const</code> rule implicitly quantifies over all Γ, and
thus the rule is schematic. The apply rule allows us to use
(eliminate) lambdas: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">App</code> says that if we call a function of type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t
-&gt; t'</code> with an input <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t</code>, then we can get an output <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t'</code>. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Lam</code>
rule allows us to build (introduce) lambdas. The rule can be
conceptualized as follows: when you reach a λ, take the type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t</code>
stipulated by the binding for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> and update Γ with a binding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{x ↦
t}</code>, then evaluate (typecheck) <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">e</code> to obtain the result of the body
expression <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t'</code>. This allows you to typecheck the entire λ with the
type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t -&gt; t'</code>.</p>

<p>The logical statements below the line represents a rule’s conclusion,
and the statements above the line represent proof obligations. If
there are no statements above the line, the proof is said to be an
assumption. Notice that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Const</code> rule obligates no statements above
the line. By contrast, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Var</code> rule obligates that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Γ(x) = t</code> must
be proven in the metatheory. An implementation may simply check this,
but a fully-formal proof would demand a totally-rigorous derivation of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code>’s value in the map Γ. The difference is subtle, but meaningful:
the more a typechecker pushes into the metatheory, the less is
explicated as a certificate that may be independently checked. The
application and lambda rules also require proofs of their premises,
and thus a proof of any nontrivial expression is in fact a tree of
well-formed judgements.</p>

<p>We may represent this tree in various ways. In the rules above it is
conveyed in a conventional symbolic representation (natural
deduction), but we just as well implement it using a structured
expression (S-expression). To adopt that approach, we define proofs as
symbolic lists built in a canonical way:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>   (rule-name antecedents ... 
              -----
              (Γ ⊢ e : t))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Proofs are recursive: each assumption will also have the same
structure (ending in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(Γ ⊢ e : t)</code>), even if it is an axiom (e.g.,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(const ----- {} ⊢ 5 : int)</code>). This allows us to define an operation
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">consequent</code> to be simply the last item in the proof:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(define consequent last)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Checking a proof involves checking the correctness of each
sub-derivation. The S-expression structure we adopted makes this
relatively simple: all rules end in their stipulated conclusions
(i.e., all terms are fully-annotated), so we may write a recursive
predicate that characterizes the well-formedness of proofs:</p>

<h2 id="soundness-and-proofs-of-the-simply-typed-λ-calculus">Soundness and Proofs of the Simply-Typed λ-Calculus</h2>

<p>STLC is sound: a term</p>

<h1 id="intuitionistic-propositional-logic">Intuitionistic Propositional Logic</h1>

<p>The Curry-Howard Isomorphism (CHI) is an oft-cited principle wherein
every well-typed program may be understood as a proof of a theorem in
a suitable logic. In the case of STLC, every well-typed STLC term is a
proof of a theorem in intuitionistic propositional logic.</p>
