  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In teaching programming language theory, we focus a lot on using
static types and intuitionistic logic to formalize the semantics of
language features. As a student, I struggled to relate the
implementation of a programming language to the formal rules we used
to define the language in mathematics. Now, in teaching my own class
on programming languages, I present natural deduction, a particular
methodology for constructing proofs about functions over inductive
datatypes. But I have taken a careful intention to focus my attention
on giving students a nuts-and-bolts description of how the math should
inform the design of interpreters for the languages we consider.</p>

<p>Within the broader programming languages ecosystem, there has been a
considerable amount written about formalizing the lambda calculus (or
other similar core languages) using statically (and often dependently)
typed languages. Seemingly the dream of every new proof assistant is
to scale to a robust implementation of programming language
metatheory. I do not see this as a bad thing, but the formal rules for
modern type theories used in proof assistants can be quite complex,
and their separation between tactic and term languages can obscure (to
the newcomer at least) the exact structure of the proof being
constructed, even in settings that emphasize proof objects. In this
post, I hope to convince you to entertain the value–in perspective
shift–to using a completely dynamically-typed language to build
proofs.</p>

<h4 id="ifarith">IfArith</h4>

<p>I will start with the language IfArith, which I describe as a
predicate in Racket:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>;; Specification of IfArith's syntax as a Racket predicate
(define (expr? e)
  (match e
    [(? integer? n) #t]
    [`(plus ,(? expr? e0) ,(? expr? e1)) #t]
    [`(div ,(? expr? e0) ,(? expr? e1)) #t]
    [`(not ,(? expr? e-guard)) #t]
    [`(if ,(? expr? e0) ,(? expr? e1) ,(? expr? e2)) #t]
    [_ #f]))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>IfArith is essentially a stripped-down functional
language. Specifically, IfArith does <em>not</em> have lambdas, and is <em>not</em>
Turing-complete. This is a crucial decision, since it allows us to
work with an almost-trivial language. My experience has been that
students’ challenges with understanding natural deduction are
orthogonal to their confusions with the lambda calculus–I think it is
best not to teach both at the same time.</p>

<p>The following are IfArith expressions:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(define e0 '(plus 2 1))
(define e1 '(if 0 (plus 1 2) (div 2 2)))
(define e2 '(if 0 (plus 1 (div 2 3)) (if 1 (plus 2 3) 0)))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When we teach students how to build interpreters, we often start by
showing metacircular interpreters. This style, following Reynold’s
definitional interpreters, uses the defining (host) language’s
features to implement the features of the target language. In this
case, it’s all simple, since there are no functions. We can build an
interpreter for IfArith as a function that observes expressions
(matching them to handle each case) and computes values (values are
the results of computation; just numbers here). By the way, to make
IfArith easy, I don’t include booleans–I interpret anything that’s 0
as false and everything else as true (an attempt to placate students
who tell us they wished we taught C).</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(define value? integer?)
(define/contract (evaluate e)
  (-&gt; expr? value?)
  (match e
    [(? integer? i) i]
    [`(plus ,e0 ,e1) (+ (evaluate e0) (evaluate e1))]
    [`(div ,e0 ,e1) (/ (evaluate e0) (evaluate e1))]
    [`(not ,e0)
     (let ([v0 (evaluate e0)])
       (if (= v0 0) 1 0))]
    [`(if ,e0 ,e1 ,e2)
     ;; anything = 0 is false, otherwise true
     (if (= 0 (evaluate e0)) (evaluate e2) (evaluate e1))]
    [_ (error "unknown expression")]))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The interpreter works as expected, as we can see by trying it on a few
examples:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(evaluate '(plus 2 1))
(evaluate '(if 0 (plus 1 2) (div 2 2)))
(evaluate '(if 0 (plus 1 (div 2 3)) (if 1 (plus 2 3) 0)))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A few remarks on the interpreter already: the interpreter inherits
some interesting properties of Racket whose importance may not be
immediately apparent. For example, we inherit Racket’s evaluation
order to implement <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code>, evaluating each subexpression left to right
(as this is the evaluation order of its interpretation in
Racket). This is in fact an implementation artifact not present in the
natural deduction semantics, as we will see.</p>

<h4 id="natural-deduction">Natural Deduction</h4>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_deduction">Natural deduction</a>
is a formalism that allows us to define the structure of a set of
logical judgments via a set of inference rules. Rules consist of a set
of premises (above the line)–all of which must be true–and a single
conclusion.</p>

<p>The inference rules for IfArith are below:</p>

<p><em>diagram</em></p>

<p>Inference rules allow us to break the definition of a large
computation–each of which carries a proof of how the computation was
performed–down into individual steps. Each of these steps is built by
combining (via a small local computation, such as calling a
constructor) proofs of the evaluation of each subexpression into a
larger proof of the ultimate interpretation of the entire expression.</p>

<p>An example proof of the evaluation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(if 1 (div 1 1) 2)</code>:</p>

<h4 id="representing-certificates">Representing Certificates</h4>

<p>We want to build to demonstrating how we can build a certifying
interpreter in Racket. We can represent certificates (i.e., the
inductive proof terms above) in Racket using the same mechanism as we
did to represent expression. Proofs always have a rule name, some
premises, a line, and finally a conclusion (for which we define a
utility projector function). Racket’s pattern matching is not
especially strong, so we have to check some properties within the
match body. Modern dependently-typed languages such as Agda, Idris,
and others put considerable effort into good higher-order unification,
though nothing prevents us doing a little DIY.</p>

<h4 id="checking-our-work">Checking our work</h4>

<p>Just to convince ourselves that this all carries over to the
dependently-typed setting, here’s the corresponding Coq code–I
simplify a few things (division, integers) for simplicity.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Inductive expr : Set :=
    Const : nat -&gt; expr
  | Plus : expr -&gt; expr -&gt; expr
  | Not : expr -&gt; expr
  | If : expr -&gt; expr -&gt; expr -&gt; expr.

Definition value := nat.

Inductive ifarith_eval : expr -&gt; value -&gt; Prop :=
  | EConst : forall (c : nat), ifarith_eval (Const c) c
  | EPlus : forall (e0 : expr) (n0 : value) (e1 : expr) (n1 : value) (nf : value),
                  ifarith_eval e0 n0 -&gt; ifarith_eval e1 n1 -&gt; nf = n0 + n1 -&gt; ifarith_eval (Plus e0 e1) nf
  | Not0 : forall (e : expr), ifarith_eval e 0 -&gt; ifarith_eval (Not e) 1
  | Not1 : forall (e: expr) (n : value), ifarith_eval e n -&gt; n &lt;&gt; 0 -&gt; ifarith_eval (Not e) 0
  | IfT : forall (e0 : expr) (n : value) (e1 : expr) (n' : value) (e2 : expr),
                 ifarith_eval e0 n -&gt; n &lt;&gt; 0 -&gt; ifarith_eval e1 n' -&gt; ifarith_eval (If e0 e1 e2) n'
  | IfF : forall (e0 : expr) (n : value) (e1 : expr) (n' : value) (e2 : expr),
                 ifarith_eval e0 n -&gt; n = 0 -&gt; ifarith_eval e2 n' -&gt; ifarith_eval (If e0 e1 e2) n'.
