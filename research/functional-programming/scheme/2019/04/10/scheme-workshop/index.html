    <p><a href="https://thomas.gilray.org/scheme-2019/"><strong>Link to this year’s Scheme Workshop CFP</strong></a></p>

<p>This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the workshop on <a href="http://www.schemeworkshop.org/">Scheme
and Functional Programming</a>. The
Scheme Workshop represents a diverse community of hackers, academics,
and enthusiasts. The workshop offers a forum to share insights,
experience, and technical developments of and within the Scheme family
of programming languages. Rather than focus on a specific
implementation or community, workshop attendees are united by an
appreciation for succinct expression of novel ideas realized via
programming. The submission deadline is <strong>May 24th, 2019</strong>, I hope
you’ll help us celebrate by submitting a paper!</p>

<h4 id="what-is-scheme-workshop">What is Scheme Workshop?</h4>

<p>The Scheme Workshop website describes it as a…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yearly meeting of programming language practitioners who share an
  aesthetic sense embodied by the Algorithmic Language Scheme:
  universality through minimalism, and flexibility through rigorous
  design.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s my personal take. I love Scheme Workshop because it brings
together a group of people with a truly unique perspective on
programming. We represent a diverse background, but a shared vision:
to distill insights about programming to their most economic
presentation. We appreciate thoughtful, comprehensible solutions to
challenging problems. We challenge ourselves to step outside of our
boundaries and build fundamentally new paradigms for expressing
ideas. Our mission is to build a community where we foster diversity,
education, and support each other in pursuit of these ideals.</p>

<p>Scheme Workshop is unique in that it is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Open to everyone who cares about Scheme-ish ideas</strong>. Instead of
   focusing on promoting the most cutting edge results, Scheme
   Workshop centers around thoughtful discussions relating to unique
   ideas that embody the ethos of Scheme. You don’t have to be an
   academic to attend; in fact, we have a rich history of
   participation from hobbyists and industrial attendees.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Non-archival and open access</strong>. We aim to support and foster unique
  ideas. Naturally, some of these ideas may grow into work
  eventually submitted to research conferences. Scheme Workshop
  provides a platform for researchers to get perspective from the
  Scheme community on their work at all stages of development. While
  we publish a technical report of submitted papers, submission to
  Scheme Workshop does not preclude subsequent submission to
  archival research conferences. In fact, we see Scheme Workshop as
  an ideal proving ground for groundbreaking research ideas. We hope
  that the discussions generated by the presentation of those ideas
  at Scheme Workshop will productively inform the authors’
  scholarship.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Supportive of off-the-wall ideas</strong>. There are some ideas that
  are really interesting, kind of zany, and just inspire us in a
  deep way we can’t quite put our finger on. These ideas aren’t
  necessarily the kind that would fit well at a programming-oriented
  conference, but they might not be a good fit for research
  conferences either. Scheme Workshop is a perfect venue for these
  kinds of ideas. You’ll find like-minded people who enjoy
  challenging their perspectives on what programming even means.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A great place for your first paper</strong>. We place an emphasis on
  giving thoughtful, high-quality, and friendly reviews. We also
  have a strong appreciation for “half-baked” ideas. When I was a
  beginning PhD student, submitting to so-called top conferences
  often felt overwhelming. Scheme Workshop wants to help budding
  researchers develop their writing and presentation. Similarly, we
  realize that great ideas can come from people in industry, the
  open-source community, or the broader hobbyist community. We work
  hard to ensure that their ideas are taken seriously and give them
  the feedback they deserve.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-about-racket-haskell-clojure-sml-c-etc">What about Racket, Haskell, Clojure, SML, C++, etc…?</h4>

<p>The language isn’t what’s important, it’s the idea. We want the
workshop to be filled with exciting talks that broaden our horizons
and challenge us to think about programming in a way we wouldn’t have
before. I could easily imagine relevant papers dealing with template
metaprogramming in C++, hygiene in OCaml, or domain-specific languages
in Clojure.</p>

<p>If you think your idea <em>might</em> be relevant to the workshop, please
don’t hesitate to contact Tom and myself. We’ll gladly give you
an honest assessment of whether your idea would be a good fit. If not,
we’ll do our best to direct you towards an appropriate venue for your
ideas.</p>

<h4 id="who-should-submit">Who should submit?</h4>

<p>Traditionally, submissions to Scheme Workshop come from those within
or adjacent to academia. However, this is <strong>not</strong> a requirement. We
welcome submissions from everyone who thinks they have something
thoughtful to say to the Scheme community. This year, I want to
specifically encourage submissions from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Undergraduate or graduate students who are looking for practice
writing papers on their own. It can be a challenge to develop your
own sense of research style. Scheme Workshop is a great place to get
feedback on your work in a low-stakes environment. Rather than judge
the quality of your work against a high technical bar, we want to
help build your ideas and presentation so that you can be proud of
the way you’re articulating them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People within the tech industry who have never written an academic
paper before. Scheme Workshop leans a bit more academic than
conferences such as RacketCon and StrangeLoop. However, this doesn’t
mean we don’t value ideas from industry. If you’re in industry and
would like to write a paper but aren’t sure how, please reach out to
me: I’m happy to Skype with you and speak frankly about how the
process works.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seasoned Scheme wizards. Scheme Workshop has a long history of
insightful talks from key contributors to the Scheme ethos. These
community members shape our vision, and guide newcomers (such as
myself!) by helping us understand the key principles that embody the
Scheme community.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="some-random-scheme-workshop-papers-i-liked">Some random Scheme Workshop papers I liked</h4>

<p>There’s truly been some amazing work at Scheme Workshop over the
years.  I can’t hope to summarize it all here. Instead, I picked a
random collection of papers to help you get an idea of the workshop’s
direction.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://schemeworkshop.org/2006/15-barzilay.pdf">A Self-Hosting Evaluator using
HOAS</a>, by Eli
Barzilay. This paper discusses how–when you’re implementing a
Scheme interpreter in Scheme–you can avoid implementing
substitution by reflecting lambdas from the source language into the
metalangauge (which still gives you means of abstracting, e.g.,
control structure). This is a neat idea that is the perfect size for
Scheme Workshop.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/03-mccarthy.pdf">Interaction-Safe State for the
Web</a> by Jay
McCarthy and Shriram Krishnamurthi. This paper discusses new
linguistic mechanisms for building abstractions for how we
understand navigation within web applications. I think this idea
nicely combines the practice of building web applications correctly
with the linguistic abstraction mechanisms afforded by Scheme.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~robby/pubs/papers/scheme2007-wf.pdf">Well-typed programs can’t be
blamed</a>
by Philip Wadler and Robby Findler. This paper from 2007 appears to
be an earlier version of the highly influential 2009 ESOP paper of the
same name.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dherman/research/papers/scheme08-stack-marks.pdf">Implementing Continuations Marks in
JavaScript</a>
by John Clements, Ayswarya Sundaram, and David Herman. This paper
discusses how continuation marks can be implemented in JavaScript. I
see this as an exciting paper exploring a novel idea in a new space,
and the authors mention some foundational challenges in scaling up
to languages that allow tail calls with conventional “return”-style
semantics.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~lkuper/papers/lambdae.pdf">A pattern matcher for miniKanren–or–How to get into trouble with
CPS macros</a>
by Andy Keep, Michael Adams, Lindsey Kuper, Will Byrd, and Dan
Friedman. This paper reveals an interesting ramification of writing
macros in a CPS-based style alongside conditional macro
expansion. They build a pattern matcher for the miniKanren
programming language, demonstrating the issue along the way. I like
that this paper reveals a foundational problem in macro engineering.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="help-us-build-a-community">Help us build a community!</h4>

<p>The goal of Scheme Workshop is to build a community that celebrates
the fun in presenting beautifully minimal ideas. We often masquerade
these ideas as programs. But we’re all bound together by the passion
we share for articulating our ideas in an elegant way. Programming
languages give us the ability to rapidly interact with our ideas,
breaking and rebuilding our realization of those ideas at a pace never
before seen by humanity. Scheme celebrates this opportunity by
allowing us unprecedented flexibility in the way we articulate and
execute these ideas.</p>

<p>I hope that you share my excitement. If you do, I sincerely hope
you’ll consider submitting a paper to <a href="https://thomas.gilray.org/scheme-2019/">the twentieth workshop on
Scheme and Functional
Programming</a>!</p>
