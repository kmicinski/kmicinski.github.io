  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I was doing some fixes recently on a tool I developed during my
PhD. It was a complicated tool—and it deserved to be—but I have
such unique memories of that time in my life; weeks filled with hours
upon hours of writing up pretty-printing infrastructure. Often this
was written in such a hacky way as to cripple the maintainability of
the entire codebase to such an extent that I had to spend hours
sitting and pulling back git diffs once I’d finally made the critical
insight.</p>

<p>The tool was binary rewriter for Android. A binary rewriter is a tool
that lets you take random binaries you find and do whatever you want
to them. This sounds only moderately hard, but surprisingly, it’s a
little harder than that. And not in the kind of way that lets you feel
like you did something meaningful, but in the kind of way that just
makes you feel like you did a really giant crossword.</p>

<p>This post is about one of those debugging sprees. I was thinking about
this recently and I thought to myself “well, maybe you just built this
bug up in your head to make it seem like all that time you wasted was
worth it.” I decided no; I didn’t build it up.</p>

<p>If you don’t believe me I even have a picture. At one point I had
tracked down this bug to such a degree that it was basically rock
solid. And then I ran the tool on a particuarly big app and I found a
particuarly… challenging… method in the app on which the tool was
epically failing. Here’s a picture of the method. Not even the whole
method, just a half of its control-flow graph (produced by, you
guessed it, my debugging output):</p>

<p>Now ask yourself: how are you feeling right now if you’re supposed to
graudate in three months and you see this crap on a Monday morning?
See those tiny lines? No, not the boxes, the lines. Yes, the lines are
the code. This was from some rendering engine.</p>

<h2 id="redexer">Redexer</h2>

<p>The tool is <a href="https://github.com/plum-umd/redexer">Redexer</a>, it’s a
giant blob of OCaml code that reads in Dalvik binaries, builds an IR,
allows you to mess with the IR, and then spits it back out. This is
useful for a few reasons. For example, you can take any app on your
phone and bolt on some extra security checks (but you have to be
careful because of things like reflection). Or you could log what the
app was doing. Or whatever else you wanted to do.</p>

<p>The challenge is that it’s actually pretty hard to just add random
code into the middle of a method without making the app crash. This is
because the code is making certain assumptions about things like the
state of registers, and if you just plow over those values it’s easy
to break these invariants. Mostly we want to just add behavior to the
code (say, logging) and otherwise leave the code alone. This is harder
than something like shellcode because there the whole point is to
change the behavior and it’s okay if the program would crash.</p>

<p>The natural question to ask right now is something like this: if the
code uses registers 0-N, why don’t you just use registers N+1 onward?
If you do that, you can get “fresh” registers. And yeah, this is
essentially what you do: we provide an API that allows you to “shift”
the registers used by a method to give yourself some number of free
ones. This means our API provides a notion of “hygiene” in terms of
its <em>data</em> use. And based around this, you can insert some code that,
for example, calls out to some method you statically link against the
app.</p>

<p>But unfortunately you hit a bit of a wall. The problem is a stupid
technicality: the instructions for moving registers are “typed”. For
instance, here are a few different <code class="highlighter-rouge">move</code> instructions:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>move $r1, $r3
move-object $r2, $r7
move-object/16 $r18, $r35
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are three “types” of registers: single (ints and floats), double
(register pairs or doubles), and object (references to
objects). There’s also an untyped <code class="highlighter-rouge">mov</code> instruction (of course this
isn’t easy). So let’s say you needed to shift registers by 10 in the
following code:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>...
const $r15, $2355
mov $r10, $r20
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Handling <code class="highlighter-rouge">$r15</code> here is easy: we can shift up to $r25 and use
<code class="highlighter-rouge">const/16</code> which allows us to load into a register beyond the range
<code class="highlighter-rouge">0-15</code>. But unfortunately,</p>
