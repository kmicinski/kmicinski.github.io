  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Computer security as a field is met with a persistent criticism:
flashy attacks are
<a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewCMyers/status/1579120278759563265">hot</a>,
boring (hard-fought) defenses are
<a href="https://www.ieee-security.org/CSFWweb/goodessay.html">not</a>. Compared
to security, programming language theory seems relatively adept at
transitioning research to mainstream practice (e.g., Rust and the
popularity of Haskell). By contrast, it would appear many of the
innovations in security have been relatively engineering-focused in
nature: W^X, ASLR, and the like. As someone who does research in this
space myself, I have wondered why this is; while I think the reasons
are myriad, I think a central challenge is the intrinsic need in
security to reason about the ever-elusive hyperproperties.</p>

<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>

<p>The <em>properties</em> of a program are mathematical statements we can make
about it’s traces. For example, consider the following program:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>while true:          # 0
  if (n % 2 == 0):   # 1
    n := n/2         # 2
  else:              # 3
    n := 3*n + 1     # 4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What could traces of this program’s execution look like? If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> is
known, we might say it is the sequence of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> paired with the
appropriate line number. For example, if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> starts at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5</code>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>⟪0, n=5⟫, ⟪1, n=5⟫, ⟪4, n=5⟫, ⟪0, n=16⟫, ⟪1, n=16⟫, ⟪2, n=16⟫, ⟪0, n=8⟫,
⟪1, n=8⟫, ⟪2, n=8⟫, ⟪0, n=4⟫, ⟪1, n=4⟫, ⟪2, n=4⟫, ⟪0, n=2⟫, ⟪1, n=2⟫, 
⟪2, n=2⟫, ⟪0, n=1⟫, ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each trace is (countably) infinite in size, without loss of generality
(as a terminating program may be thought of as infinitely repeating a
final <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">skip</code> state). Quantifying over the input is possible by
producing an infinite set of (infinite) traces. For example, one
property of the above (set of) traces is this: the suffix of every
trace is the (infinite loop) <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">⟪0, n=4⟫, ⟪1, n=4⟫, ⟪2, n=4⟫, ⟪0, n=2⟫,
⟪1, n=2⟫, ⟪2, n=2⟫, ⟪0, n=1⟫, ...</code>.</p>

<p>The trace-based nature inherent to this style of semantics is a core
challenge in checking properties of the associated programs, because
computers may only materialize a finite approximation of infinite
objects. Unfortunately, the exact nature of this approximation can
deeply impact the kind of properties which may be checked. This is
why the different approaches to program modeling and verification
often pair a representation with an intended logic:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Model checking allow the user to specify the program using a
domain-specific languages (see, e.g., <a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/book-21-07-04.pdf">Chapter 2.3 of the TLA+
book</a>)
which compiles into an automaton. This is no coincidence: statements
in temporal logics also map cleanly to the same automata (an
extension of finite automata called Büchi automata), at which point
automata-theoretic constructions (intersection, complementation,
etc…) may be used.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Abstract interpretation recognizes that the infinite behavior may be
finitized by approximating values in the semantics as elements of a
lattice allow using a <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~cousot/COUSOTpapers/publications.www/CousotCousot-POPL-77-ACM-p238--252-1977.pdf">fixed-point theorem to obtain
tractability</a>. In
this setting, a set of traces is often modeled as an abstract state
<em>graph</em>, the deterministic nature of traces often being lost in the
(necessary) finite approximation; paths through the abstract state
graph then correspond to traces in the (infinite) semantics. Using
this style, an abstract interpreter materializes a state graph and
then checks a property (e.g., the inclusion of a specific data flow)
by examining this abstract representation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Symbolic execution keeps a <em>symbolic</em> representation of the program
state, and thus produces symbolic traces. The problem is that
symbolic execution can only materialize finite portions of these
traces, and thus it is impossible to reason about infinite
behavior. Thus, a symbolic executor includes a “scheduler” which
picks how to explore paths to avoid unproductive exploration. A
central challenge in symbolic execution is how to avoid getting
stuck early on in the trace. This problem is avoided in (say)
abstract interpretation by allowing the abstract state graph to
discover spurious edges, allowing reasoning from the “middle” of the
program, but at the cost of adding traces not present in the
original program.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Axiomatic semantics (e.g., Hoare triples) allows the user to
annotate the program with specifications, which are subsequently
enumerated to “verification conditions.” The semantics, and thus the
set of traces, is implicitly represented as the set of valid program
states which would satisfy the necessary verification conditions at
any specific point in the program. Metatheoretic results justify the
way in which we may stitch these verification conditions together to
obtain an end-to-end correct program. Still no free lunch here,
however, as the programmer often needs to articulate tedious loop
invariants in an iterative process with the verification tool.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="safety-and-liveness">Safety and Liveness</h2>

<p>Surprisingly, all properties of programs can be broken down into a
combination of two things: a “safety” property, and a “liveness”
property.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Safety properties are things which can be refuted using finite
counterexamples. For example, if a program has a use-after-free
vulnerability, you will be able to demonstrate some exploit wherein
memory is freed and then subsequently (but in a finite time horizon)
accessed. I.e., “bad things don’t happen.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Liveness properties are things which require some finite proof of
progress. The quintessential liveness examples are guaranteed
service or starvation freedom.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For example, consider the following concurrent code, wherein process 1
and 2 operate concurrently:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>n := 0
sem := 1

Process 1:
  while true:
    take(sem)
    i := 0
    while (i != n):
      skip
    n := n + 1
    rel(sem)

Process 2:
  while true:
    take(sem)
    if (n &gt;= 7)
      *NULL; // crash
    rel(sem)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Assuming a fair scheduler, the program will eventually
crash. Demonstrating this requires only that we enumerate a thread
schedule wherein we choose process 1 to take <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sem</code> (at least) seven times. A
similar argument holds for any arbitrarily-picked natural number, thus
the statement we’re making is one of safety.</p>

<p>Things that are crash-like (vulnerabilities, memory errors, etc…)
are often safety properties. In fact, safety properties are so common
it is not obvious that there are other kinds of properties. At least, this
is probably true for computer scientists, pained by their hours of
debugging safety properties. By contrast, liveness properties say that
“good things” happen eventually. Examples include guaranteed
availability and (surprisingly, perhaps) termination.</p>

<p>Formally, a liveness property has the form: “for all traces t0, there
exists an extension t1 such that t0⋅t1 ⊨ P.” Termination is a simple
instance of this liveness template, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P</code> states that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t1</code> is a
stream of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">skip</code> expressions. The fact that any trace property of a
program may be factored into a combination of a safety property and
liveness property follows from the topological interpretation where
(a) safety properties represent closed sets (of traces) and (b)
liveness properties represent open sets. I am not an expert on
liveness, and will instead point you at the <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/fbs/publications/DefLiveness.pdf">main paper I’ve read on
it</a>.</p>

<h2 id="properties-and-their-proofs">Properties and Their Proofs</h2>

<p>It is hard to understate how much work has been done in checking
safety and liveness properties of programs. Because safety properties
feel like crashes, and programmers really hate crashes, we have
naturally developed a huge amount of our programming culture around
methods designed to help us understand and avoid crashes. Broadly,
this breaks down into static checking / verification and dynamic
auditing / enforcement / logging. For example, the central aim of most
program analyses is to check safety properties of programs, including
avoidance of crashes, errors, and similar faults, and reifies in
vastly-different ways from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printf</code>-style debugging to abstract
interpretation and program analysis tools (like Astrée, Soot, and
DOOP), to program verification frameworks (like
<a href="https://github.com/EasyCrypt/certicrypt">CertiCrypt</a>). This is not to
say there is no great work in the area (e.g., the <a href="https://github.com/mmjb/T2">Terminator
project</a>), but rather that I think most of
us have a natural intuition for safety properties as programmers.</p>

<p>Notice that one I have left out until now is type systems. Type
systems feel very different than the methods I described above,
because they are prescriptive in nature and do not so obviously lead
to a trace-based semantics. The semantics of a type system is designed
to be compositional in the manner of natural deduction, which feels
very different than the trace-based nature of safety and liveness
properties.</p>

<h2 id="hyperproperties">Hyperproperties</h2>

<p>Hyperproperties allow us to talk about multiple traces of a program at
the same time. It is not immediately clear why this would be useful,
but some of the most motivating examples are from computer
security. For example, consider the following program:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Process 1:
  while true:
    s = read(secret)
    if (s == 0):
	  o = 1
    else:
      o = 0

Process 2:
  while true:
    out(o)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">secret</code> is a stream of secret (binary) values. Is it possible to
infer <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">secret</code> from the (buffered) output? Of course: we just change
the 1s to 0s. Formally, though, it’s a bit hard to think about a
general property that would allow us to speak about the relationship
between the input and the output that would avoid this.</p>

<p>It turns out this kind of obliviousness or “noninterference” is a more
general kind of program property, a proper that can simultaneously
quantify over two traces at once. The original formulation applied to
sequential programs, for example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>if (secret == 0):
  out = 1
else:
  out = 1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The program does not leak information because for every trace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t0</code>, there
exists another trace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t1</code> such that the outputs are equivalent but the
inputs are not. Informally: the output of the program does not depend
on the secret input. Extending the definition of noninterference to
concurrent systems proved hard because of a basic challenge: once the
thread schedule is tainted by a secret value (e.g., by branching on a
secret and then doing something schedule-specific), non-local
reasoning must be done to ensure the thread schedule’s safety–all the
hell of concurrent programming, doubled.</p>

<p>This is the point at which I would say, off-hand, “a particularly cool
idea by Zdancewic and Myers is to <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/papers/csfw03.pdf">statically-ensure observational
determinism</a>.”
But, as thinking over this, I realized: the coolest results for
<em>checking</em> hyperproperties I can find are <em>intensional</em> systems (a
type system, in this case) to ensure the <em>extensional</em> guarantees
necessitated by hyperproperties.</p>

<h2 id="proofs-of-hyperproperties">Proofs of Hyperproperties</h2>

<p>Unlike proofs of safety and liveness, relatively little work has been
done on proofs for hyperproperties. This is no insult to people
working in this research direction; finding bugs in one trace at a
time is proving hard enough, it seems.</p>

<p>I speculate that this is because each new advance in logics for safety
checking corresponded with advances to the intensional representation
used to check those properties. Model checking became a huge deal once
we realized there were relatively simple automata-theoretic algorithms
to do it, but also because of the advent of
<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs357/cegar.pdf">CEGAR-style</a>
methods. By contrast, I think similar advances happen in security
coinciding with advances in intensional checking mechanisms for
hyperproperties. For example, the aforementioned CertiCrypt and
 <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/jif/">Jif</a>.</p>

<p>A unifying trick to much of this work is to make hyperproperties
become just regular properties by having the semantics generate
<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-21437-0_17"><em>pairs</em> of
traces</a>,
and then cooking up a version of a hypersafety statement of interest
to speak about these pairs.  This draws a connection between
hyperproperties and the large body of literature on relational program
verification. In some of my own work, we tried to use ideas from
<a href="https://projects.csail.mit.edu/jeeves/papers/plas07-austin.pdf">faceted
execution</a>
to push the pairs from the trace-level to <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9155136">the value
level</a>. In other work I
did on model checking for hyperproperties, we just used a product
construction—the CEGAR algorithm would need to be updated to refine
states appropriately, but we did not attempt that. These efforts are
rooted in the intuition that we may exploit the rich body of work from
program analyses and the like to immediately reason about these pairs
of traces, but there is no free lunch, and making the abstractions
work in practice is seriously challenging.</p>

<p>However, I have come think many of these efforts may be ultimately
fruitless compared to using secure-by-construction building
blocks. Once you’re at the level of needing to reason about
noninterference, you’re already in a pretty serious threat
model—timing channels and the like are going to be ever-present, and
will necessitate increasingly-advanced program logics, CEGAR-style
reasoning, and similar technologies, I believe. Any state-based
abstraction of the program will be destined to imprecision which will
eventually fall apart if the abstraction is not tightly tied to (and
derived from) the program’s semantics in a predictable way, but the
necessary explosion of the state graph (from the product construction)
implies serious complexity-theoretic challenges here, I worry.</p>

<p>Thus, I claim we haven’t and won’t see hyperproperties (as they are
now) take off as a general way to give us new innovations in proofs of
security properties for programs. Instead, like the innovations in
safety properties, I think we’ll see more and more specialized
hyperproperties gain steam hand-in-hand with new innovations in
checking those properties. But crucially, I think these will be
<em>intensional</em> in nature: more security type systems, popular libraries
which provide secure communication channels whose API satisfies
hypersafety guarantees when used properly, “secure linking” DSLs at
the binary layer which ensure specific invariants to guarantee
end-to-end correctness. I claim the most useful security innovations
(bounds checking, bytecode verification, etc..) have truly been safety
properties, constructed and used in a way to guarantee (a specific
instance of) hypersafety in practice.</p>
